INFO

Additional requirements

pyisomd5sum
	isomd5sum (Fedora)
	python-pyisomd5sum (Ubuntu)

Ampache setup

Read Ampache Access Control Lists documentation and create an ACL for RPC (XML API)
	http://trac.ampache.org/wiki/ConfigAcl

Rhythmbox setup

Untar and put the ampache directory into $HOME/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins
or /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins

Run rhythmbox (preferable with "-D ampache" from command line)

Click Edit, select Plugins dialog box, enable "Ampache Library"

Click Configure, enter your infromation, for example URL:
	http://test.com/server/xml.server.php

Click on Ampache under Library, songs should appear in the browser
(possibly with a large delay as it synchronosly downloads the data)


TODO/BUGS/FIXME

 - Store usernames and passwords in gnome-keyring
 - Allow multiple instances of ampache
 - Support playlists

 - Use async I/O
 - Use limit= and offset= to get songs in chunks and db.commit() inbetween

 - Fix genres - shows up as numbers right now
 - Fix date - not implemented in Ampache yet(?)

 - Don't store constants that are not settings in gconf

 - Figured out why "-D ampache" doesn't work if I run rhythmbox from ampache
   plugin directory

 - Remember View->Browse state (and enable by default?)

 - Try to keep the catalog persistent (add api to ampache to version catalogs?)

 - Figure out why dragging song to local library works but to iPod does not

 - Fix RB sorting to ignore articles (the, a, etc - ampache has a good list)

 - Proxy support (?)

19-04-2010 - Graham Grindlay <grindlay@ee.columbia.edu> 
  * Added a few small fixes to keep the plugin from choking on bad/empty tag data. 
  * Genre tags didn't seem to be coming through properly so I set them using the "tag"
    field instead.  This seems to work fine, although if multiple tags are associated
    with a track, only the first one will be used.  If you don't like this, you can
    just comment out line 148 (self.db.set(e, rhythmdb.PROP_GENRE, e_genre))
